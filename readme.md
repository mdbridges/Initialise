EmbraceIT New Site Design.

Purpose:
Our Webiste is is old and has been coded using software that is no longer avilable.
The only way forawrd is to re-code the site, this time from the ground up, with our new found(or rediscovered) knowledge.

Using Github we are able to collaborate fully as this project develops.

Launch Date for new site: Monday 5th August 2013
